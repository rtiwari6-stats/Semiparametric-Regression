From the book “Regression is used to understand the relationships between predictor variables and response variables and for predicting the latter using the former. In parametric regression, the effect of each predictor has a simple form, for example, is a linear or exponential function, so that its overall shape is dictated by the model, not
the data. In contrast, with nonparametric regression the model is flexible enough to allow any smooth trend in the data. Semiparametric regression combines parametrically modeled effects for some predictors with nonparametric modeling of the effects of the other variables.”
